## Introduction

AIHubMatrix is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly web application designed to be your single point of interaction with a wide range of AI models from different providers. It's built for researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to experiment with and compare different AI models without the hassle of switching between platforms. AIHubMatrix solves the problem of fragmented AI interaction by providing a central hub, advanced conversation management, and unique features like in-conversation model switching. It allows you to seamlessly switch between models, manage complex conversations, organize your work with folders, and integrate with multiple leading AI providers.

Rather than being locked into a single AI provider or model, AIHubMatrix serves as your central hub for AI interactions, adapting to your specific needs with a clean, intuitive interface. The system comes pre-configured with templates for the most popular models, but you can easily add any model that works with the supported APIs.

## Key Differentiators

What truly sets AIHubMatrix apart from other AI interfaces? Here are the features that make it unique and powerful:

### üîÑ Dynamic, In-Conversation Model Switching

This is a game-changer. Most AI interfaces lock you into a single model for an entire conversation. AIHubMatrix lets you *change models on the fly, mid-conversation*. Ask a question with one model, get a response, then switch to a different model for a different perspective or to leverage its specific strengths. This is invaluable for:

- **Comparative Analysis:** Directly compare how different AIs approach the same prompt.
- **Task Specialization:** Use the best model for each stage of your workflow (e.g., brainstorming with one model, refining with another).
- **Fallback Options:** If one model struggles, instantly switch to another.
- **Cost Optimization:** Use powerful (and potentially more expensive) models only when needed.

### üéõÔ∏è Fine-Grained Conversation Control

AIHubMatrix gives you unprecedented control over your conversation history:

- **Message Exclusion/Inclusion:** Don't just delete messages ‚Äì *exclude* them from the AI's context. This lets you experiment with different lines of questioning without permanently losing your work. You can toggle messages in and out of the context as needed.
- **Selective Deletion:** Of course, you can also permanently delete messages if you choose.
- **Conversation as a Living Document:** Think of your conversations as dynamic documents, not just static transcripts.

### üëÅÔ∏è Universal Vision Capabilities

AIHubMatrix makes *every* AI model "vision-capable," even if it doesn't natively support image input:

- **Native Support:** For models like GPT-4o and Claude 3, images are sent directly.
- **Google Vision Integration:** For text-only models, AIHubMatrix automatically uses Google Vision to analyze images and provide detailed text descriptions to the AI. This opens up a world of possibilities.

### üîå Resilient Connections & Background Processing

Never lose your work due to a dropped connection. AIHubMatrix:

- **Continues processing** even if your internet connection is interrupted.
- Provides **real-time status updates** during long operations.
- **Automatically delivers** the completed response when you reconnect.
- Includes **intelligent timeouts** to prevent indefinite processing.

### üìÅ Folder Organization

Unlike many interfaces that only offer a flat list of conversations, AIHubMatrix lets you organize your work into hierarchical folders, just like you would on your computer.

### üíæ Conversation Cache

Pre-load context and files into a specific conversation, giving you fine-grained control over the AI's "knowledge base" for that interaction.

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly

- Clean, modular architecture (React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database).
- Easy deployment with Docker.
- Built-in debugging tools.

### üåê True Multi-Provider Support

AIHubMatrix isn't tied to a single vendor. It's designed to work with a growing list of providers, giving you maximum flexibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Docker:** [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* **Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* **Git:** [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aihubmatrix.git
   cd aihubmatrix/Docker
   ```
   **Replace `yourusername/aihubmatrix.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.**

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit the `.env` file:** Fill in the required values:

   * `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: A strong password for the PostgreSQL root user.
   * `MYSQL_DATABASE`: The database name (default: `AI`).
   * `MYSQL_USER`: The database user (default: `AI`).
   * `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: A strong password for the database user.
   * `NODE_PORT`: The port Node.js will use (default: `3000`, mapped to 443 and 80).
   * `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`.
   * `DB_HOST`: The database host (default: `db`, the Docker service name).
   * `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`: Your initial administrator email address.
   * `SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`: A *strong* password for the initial administrator.
   * `JWT_SECRET`: A *very strong, randomly generated secret* for JWT. Generate one:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -base64 32
     ```
     Paste the output into the `.env` file.

4. **Configure AI Models (models-config.json):**

   * Edit `Docker/node/src/config_templates/models-config.json`.
   * **Obtain API Keys:** You *must* obtain API keys from the AI providers you want to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). See the "API Integration" section below for links to their documentation.
   * **Enable Models:** Set `"enabled": true` for the models you want to use.
   * **Enter API Keys:** Replace the placeholder values for `"apiKey"` and `"Authorization"` (if needed) with your actual API keys. *Never* commit your API keys to version control.
   * **Adjust Endpoints (if necessary):** The `endpoint` should be correct for most models, but double-check the provider's documentation.
   * **Customize Model Parameters:** Adjust `maxTokens`, `temperature`, and other parameters as needed.
   * **Local Models:** For local models (like Ollama), set `requiresApiKey` to `false` and provide the correct `endpoint`.

5. **Build and Run:**

   ```bash
   make all
   ```

   This command builds the Docker images and starts the containers.

6. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `https://localhost`. You will likely see a security warning because of the self-signed certificates. Proceed with caution (see "HTTPS Certificates" below).

### Initial Login

Log in with the `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL` and `SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in your `.env` file.

### HTTPS Certificates (IMPORTANT)

**The default setup uses self-signed certificates for development. These are NOT secure for production.** You *must* replace them.

**Options:**

1. **Let's Encrypt (Recommended):**
   * Requires a domain name pointing to your server.
   * Use a tool like Certbot (often integrated with Docker Compose). Search for "docker compose letsencrypt" for instructions.

2. **Manual Certificate Installation:**
   * Obtain SSL certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA).
   * Place your `.crt` (certificate) and `.key` (private key) files in the `Docker/cert` directory.
   * Ensure the filenames match your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com.crt`, `yourdomain.com.key`).
   * Restart Docker: `make down && make all`

3. **Reverse Proxy:**
   * Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy) *in front of* the AIHubMatrix containers.
   * Configure the reverse proxy to handle SSL termination.
